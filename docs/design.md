## Route Optimization Algorithm

### Priority Scoring System

The optimization algorithm uses a weighted scoring system that considers multiple factors to determine the optimal delivery sequence:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Delivery Priority] --> B[Route Score]
    C[Temperature Risk] --> B
    D[Time Urgency] --> B
    E[Distance] --> B
    B --> F[Optimized Sequence]
```

#### 1. Priority Factors

1. **Time Urgency Score (40% weight)**
   - Based on delivery window and current time
   - Formula: `urgency_score = (current_time - window_start) / (window_end - window_start)`
   - Higher score for deliveries closer to their deadline
   - Penalty multiplier for high-priority deliveries

2. **Temperature Risk Score (30% weight)**
   - Considers food temperature sensitivity
   - Formula: `temp_risk = (current_time - pickup_time) / max_safe_time`
   - Higher risk for temperature-sensitive items
   - Penalty for exceeding safe temperature thresholds

3. **Distance Score (30% weight)**
   - Based on distance from current location
   - Formula: `distance_score = 1 / (1 + distance_in_km)`
   - Normalized using Haversine formula
   - Considers both pickup and delivery locations

#### 2. Route Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_route_score(delivery, current_location, current_time):
    # Time urgency component
    time_ratio = (current_time - delivery.window_start) / (delivery.window_end - delivery.window_start)
    urgency_score = min(1.0, max(0.0, time_ratio)) * delivery.priority
    
    # Temperature risk component
    time_since_pickup = current_time - delivery.pickup_time
    temp_risk = min(1.0, time_since_pickup / delivery.max_safe_time)
    
    # Distance component
    distance = haversine_distance(current_location, delivery.pickup_location)
    distance_score = 1 / (1 + distance)
    
    # Weighted final score
    final_score = (
        0.4 * urgency_score +
        0.3 * (1 - temp_risk) +  # Invert temp risk for scoring
        0.3 * distance_score
    )
    
    return final_score
```

### ETA Calculation

The Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) is computed using:

```python
def calculate_eta(delivery, current_location, current_time):
    # Base travel time (assuming average speed of 30 km/h)
    distance = haversine_distance(current_location, delivery.pickup_location)
    base_travel_time = distance / 30  # in hours
    
    # Add buffer for traffic conditions
    traffic_factor = get_traffic_factor(current_time, current_location)
    adjusted_travel_time = base_travel_time * traffic_factor
    
    # Add handling time (5 minutes per delivery)
    handling_time = 5 / 60  # in hours
    
    # Calculate final ETA
    eta = current_time + timedelta(hours=adjusted_travel_time + handling_time)
    
    return eta
```

### Assumptions and Constraints

1. **Time Assumptions**
   - Average vehicle speed: 30 km/h
   - Standard handling time: 5 minutes per delivery
   - Traffic conditions are predictable within time windows
   - No unexpected delays (accidents, road closures)

2. **Temperature Assumptions**
   - Food temperature remains constant during transit
   - Maximum safe time starts from pickup
   - Temperature-sensitive items have priority
   - No temperature control equipment failures

3. **Route Assumptions**
   - Direct routes between points
   - No one-way street restrictions
   - No parking constraints
   - No delivery location access restrictions

4. **Capacity Constraints**
   - Vehicle capacity is sufficient for all deliveries
   - No weight restrictions
   - No special handling requirements
   - No vehicle type restrictions

### Optimization Process

1. **Initial Filtering**
   - Remove completed deliveries
   - Filter by delivery window
   - Check temperature constraints

2. **Scoring Phase**
   - Calculate scores for all valid deliveries
   - Apply priority multipliers
   - Consider current location

3. **Sequencing Phase**
   - Sort deliveries by final score
   - Validate sequence against constraints
   - Adjust for time windows

4. **ETA Calculation**
   - Compute ETAs for each delivery
   - Validate against delivery windows
   - Adjust sequence if needed

### Real-time Adjustments

The system continuously monitors and adjusts routes based on:

1. **Dynamic Updates**
   - Real-time traffic conditions
   - Driver location updates
   - New delivery requests
   - Cancellations

2. **Re-optimization Triggers**
   - Significant delay in current delivery
   - New high-priority delivery
   - Temperature risk threshold exceeded
   - Traffic condition changes

3. **Fallback Strategies**
   - Alternative routes
   - Driver reassignment
   - Delivery window adjustments
   - Priority overrides
